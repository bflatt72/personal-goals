Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.

# Overarching Goals
1. Contribute to Open Source
2. Write more blog posts
3. Use the terminal more
4. Get better at Web Development
5. Learn about JavaScript and associated frameworks
6. Be kind
7. Un-wind
