### Stream of Consciousness

The other day I decided to start writing every single day, even if it's just all gibberish and whatever comes to my mind. The following is the result of the first day. I intended to write for 15 minutes, but thought that would be too difficult, so I settled on five minutes. At first I just sat there staring at the screen, and then I started writing. And writing. And writing. You don't have to agree with everything I said here. I don't agree with everything I said here. But it's how I felt at the moment and still do, the vast majority of the time. Nothing said in the following words was meant to disparage any individual people. It's about all of us. 

Note: I originally wrote this as one long paragraph. Everything you are about to read is exactly the way I wrote it, except for editing into paragraphs and highligting of specific words. And inserted the link for 750 Words. 




I recently decided to commit to writing for at least 5 minutes every single day. After this is solidified into a habit, I can increase the amount of time spent writing every day. I remember there used to a website called 500 words or something like that, probably still exists, I should look it up, [750 Words](http://750words.com) where I had an account, and the idea was to write so many words every single day. This would be a great way to get ideas out of my head and onto the screen and it will be cool to be able to go back and see what the hell I was thinking over a period of time.

I guess I'll just free associate and do this stream of conscious style, although I am no James Joyce or Faulkner. I am full of Sound and Fury though. I actually had to just go look up those two names even though I know those writers well. I am absolutely horrible with names and I'm not sure why. Earlier today, in talking to a co-worker I forgot both Taylor Swift's and Justin Bieber's name. How does that happen? I actually just now almost forgot Bieber's name again. What the hell is wrong with me? Oh well, I remarked that Bieber has kinda fell off the face of the earth lately, haven't heard anything from him in awhile. That's kinda good thing. I wish Trump would do the same and spare us all. I still can't believe that there are millions of Americans who not only voted for him, but like him and still support him to this day. How does that work? How can two people have such diametrically opposed viewpoints? How is it that people can have world views that are so polar opposite? 

Then this also dovetails into fake news and the spread of it, and how so many people believe everything they read online and have absolutely no ability at all to discern what's true or not, or not even that, but what is reputable and what is not. They send me links to bogus websites and don't even check out the links themselves. They see things on Facebook or other social media and they automatically believe it if it comports with their world view and their previously held beliefs. That's how most people operate. Most people aren't interested in learning anything, or seeing things from another perspective, or really finding out what's true, they're only interested in justifying their own beliefs and finding ways to support what they already believe is true. How people in 2017 can believe we never went to the moon or that the earth is flat is beyond me, but it all basically and really boils down to a lack of education. 

That's the problem with most things these days. You drive up to West Virginia or other coal areas and you see such economic devastation because of the decline of coal, all of which they blame Obama for, and you realize that a large proportion of these people have no education, not even a basic level. They are born into and perpetuate poverty and don't know how to get out. Education isn't cool anymore these days. You really are a nerd or a geek if you enjoy learning and kids today, a lot of them, just don't have time for it and then they get addicted to opiods which is a huge epidemic and it's all related to each other. People can't get educated even if they want to if they're addicted to drugs but addicted to drugs or not or poor or not, most everyone in this country has some sort of access to the internet, which should be a good thing, but in a world, or a country, that is so sorely lacking in education, they don't know how to discern what they read. 

Even the Bible exhorts its readers to be discerning. So few have this ability anymore these days. They repeat things they see on Facebook, memes largely, and they share them and when you call them on the false nature of the premises of these memes, you're told that they just shared it because they found it funny. Truth doesn't seem to matter much. It's all about how things make people feel. If it feels truthy then it's truth or could be and if it could be true and/or if it's funny it gets shared around and goes viral. I don't know how many times I've tried to correct people on the false nature of certain memes they've shared, only to see it shared again the very next day by someone else. It's a losing battle and I finally realized that you can't change minds on social media anyway and if you try you're just wasting your time and energy.

The nature of social media itself is another huge topic and I've read a few articles of late from people who have either never been on social media or who have quit and I admire them and I'm trying myself. I'm really not on FB that much anymore. I NEVER just sit and scroll my feed anymore. I do post pics from time to time and will share funny memes about the gym that I see from instagram but other than that I don't spend a lot of time on FB anymore. I did get back on twitter a few weeks ago but I feel like with twitter, if done right, can be a lot better in that you can curate who you follow and you can follow smart people and you can learn a lot. You don't have to follow that crazy cousin who you're always fighting and arguing with about Trump. You don't have to on FB either, you can unfollow anyone you want, but once you unfollow everyone, then FB becomes pointless.

I also have just felt for a very long time that the most successful people in life probably in general don't spend a lot of time on FB if at all. It's just a huge time dump and there's absolutely no reward. As the saying goes, if it's free you're the product and that's what you are to Zucky boy. A product, eyeballs looking at advertising. Ive always said that FB isn't a technology company at all, they're an advertising business. They're in advertising, that's how they make their money. He doesn't want to bring the world together for any altruistic reasons on his part but only to grow the company's bottom line. The more people that spend more time on FB means more advertising dollars and we are the product. At least with TV you can watch what entertains you, in between the commercials, but on FB you're made to just sit and mindlessly scroll. 

Like cigarette companies of old,they study how to manipulate our minds so that we become addicted to their product, which is each other. We are addicted to the likes and the comments, even if it is mostly arguing and it gets our blood boiling. I hate it. I've always hated it but until recently haven't been able to put it down. I guess since I started #100daysofcode and started school too and have had less time for FB, it's just fallen by the wayside. I can remember being on myspace when facebook came along and were the cool kids, back when you had to be a part of a university or friends with someone who was to even get an account. At least with myspace everyone had their own profile pages and that's how everyone interacted, by indivicually messaging each other. 

But FB is entirely driven by the feed. If you had to actually go and look at all 100 of your friends indididual profiles, it wouldn't be as addictive. 

The feed. 

That's what it's all about. 

Mindless. 

Self induldgence. 

Non intentional. 

Just doing what one has always done. 

Bored. 

Nothing to do. 

Just scroll. 

You'll be happier if you do.

Except you're not. 

You're afraid of missing out. 

You'll even wake up in the middle of the night and grab for your phone and open up your feed. 

The feed is a monster. 

Have to know what's going on all the time. 

At all times.

Even though nothing of note is ever really going on. 

Not with your friends on facebook. 

People brag, they don't show their true selves.

It's a mask. 

Their representative, as Chris Rock used to say about dating. 

According to your feed, everyone else is 

#happier 

and 

#leaner 

and

#stronger

and 

#smarter 

and 

#better parents 

and 

#better husbands 

and 

#wives. 

Everyone is better than you. 

Except the ones that aren't. 

We love that don't we. 

Compare. 

I'm better than they are.

Look at their 

#Bullshit 

Look at all their 

#drama. 

Man they're fucked up. 

But me? 

I may not have it ALL together but I'm better than they are. Maybe not as perfect as all the 

#"beautiful people" Marilyn Manson sang about, but I'm somewhere in the middle. 

Except FB doesn't make me want to aspire to anything greater or better. No one goes on there to better themselves or to make others feel better about themselves. It's all about an image. 

Gotta protect the image. 

Gotta portray the image. 

On the feed. 

It's a monster. 

It consumes. 

It destroys. 

literally and figuratively. 

It destroys 

#minds 

and 

#families 

and 

#friendships. 

Why do I gotta know that this person went out to eat at Denny's today? Why is that important? Why do I gotta see his pics of his bacon and eggs? Why can't people be more private anymore? 

Gotta share everything. 

Share it all. 

#Vomit! 

Exorcise the 

#demons 

onto 

the #feed. 

Intake the demons right back into our souls. 

Our vapid, soul less, mindless, souls. 

#Ghouls. 

I hate it. 

I won't do it anymore. 

I wanna learn. I wanna better myself. I've found it funny how that the younger generation, a lot of times, aren't even using FB anymore. They got off of FB when their parents and grandparents got on it. The kids are on snapchat and their parents and grandparents are addicted to FB, the same way they're addicted to their pain meds and their xanax. 

They get on there and spread gossip. 

They ARE the gossip. 

They lead shallow lives. 

They are the matrix. 

Making billions as a product for FB.

Orwell had us all scared to death about big brother being the government. 

Big brother is ourselves and our own vapid empty lives, spent almost completely on social media. 

We can't even do anything anymore without thinking this would be great to put on FB, this would be a great pic.

I gotta share this pic.

Ive thought about quitting FB in the past and my first thought was to go on FB and share with everyone how I was gonna quit FB. 

#Ironic. 

I've always wondered if I just left, how long it would take anyone to even notice my absence. I don't think anyone would for quite awhile if at all because everyone is so into themselves and comparing themselves to everyone else.

I wonder what Tom 

![Tom from Myspace](https://github.com/bflatt72/bflatt72.github.io/blob/master/img/tom.jpg)

from Myspace 

is up to these days. 

Remember him? 

No one does anymore. 

Who's Tom?

Now it's Mark. 

I wouldn't be surprised if Tom doesn't work at FB now. 

Working for Mark. 

Like we all work for Mark. 

I'm reminded me of the "old days" of email forwards. How God awful those things were. People, friends and family, who had your email address, who you had given your email address for a specific reason, maybe they wanted to send you some pictures or some files or something but then they felt as if they had a right to bombard your mail box with their bullshit. They would never do that with real snail mail. they would never send their political and religous bullshit straight to your doorstep but with email they felt they could and they did. 

It got so bad, I eventually had to change my email address and not give it out. A few times I've gone back to the old address to look for something and I've noticed some of these people are still sending me their bullshit, but for the most part that whole phase of existence has died out and has been replaced by the FB meme. 

Now they don't even have to send it to you specifically or to their entire email address book, now they can just post it to their feed and subject everyone to their bullshit. 

I guess I can't really talk because a few years ago I was really bad for sharing my political and religious ideas, not caring who saw it or what they thought. But I grew tired of it and realized what a waste of time it is. 

I would love to be able to quantify how much time I've literally spent on FB, 

that's 

#time 

#time 

#time 

that can't be gotten back. 

That's

#time 

#time 

#time 

gone. 

#Wasted. 

Time could have been spent reading a book or teaching myself how to code or going to the gym or heaven forbid SPENDING TIME WITH MY FAMILY. 

It's awful how much of our lives are spent staring into our screens. Maybe it's like alcohol. Some people can handle it in moderation, they can pick it up and they can put it down but for many millions of us we can't. 

We are 

#addicted. 

We gotta have it. 

And just like cigarettes, it was designed that way. 

I want to live my life with more intentionality. I want to be intentional about everything I do. I don't wanna reach for my phone just because I'm bored. Reach for a book or my kindle and read. Read a long blog post. Do 5 minutes of coding. Learn a bit more about JavaScript. 

#Learn. 

#Read. 

#Do. Social media is meant to be passive, not active. All that time spent, 

#wasted, 

what has anyone actually gotten out of it that's worthwhile? What have we gotten for our time, besides empty vacuous lives? 

# We can do better. 

# I can do better. 

# I will do better.
